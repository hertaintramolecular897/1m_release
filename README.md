# The 1,024,000² 2b2t World Download Project (1m²). And More.
It's finally here. Around 24 TB total of 2b2t world data, which includes the following:
- a 1,024,000² (1m²) area of the Overworld (Dec 25 2025 - Apr 13 2026),
- a 512,000² (512k²) area of the Overworld (Nov 11 2024 - Dec 12 2024),
- a 256,000² (256k²) area of the End (Jan 23 2026 - Feb 15 2026),
- a 100,000² (100k²) area of the Nether (Jun 9 2025 - Jun 14 2025)

This wasn't easy to accomplish in the slightest, and took over a year of constant development and stress testing. With
severe weaponized autism, the help of several people involved, thousands of dollars spent, and countless hours wasted,
we present you the largest world download project ever, on 2b2t, and in Minecraft. Let's break down what exactly
happened. This has been brought to you by crayne (me), Fuch, mahan, Steve3, and many more. Watch the SalC1 video about 
the topic [here](https://youtu.be/HDyze1YlOrI). We also released some timelapses of our bots downloading this area on 
our [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/zpOhk027LpI).

# TLDR of what happened
- Fuch and I started a project to download a large area of the server. I created a custom file format to save on storage,
  along with a custom world download server, and a basic autopilot.
- At the end of 2024, we launched 28 bot accounts on BMProxy to download a 512k² Overworld area, with the intent to find
  bases, and covering up the entire thing as a fake larp coord exploit with the Enclave. This was achieved within 17 days.
- In June of 2025, 2b2t finally updated to 1.21.4, and the nether roof was accidentally left enabled. We decided to use
  this while it was possible, and promptly launched 6 accounts to download a 100k² Nether area, finishing in under a week.
- Right after Christmas Eve of 2025, we launched a new project to download a 1m² Overworld area of the server. We also 
  went and manually gapfilled some missing parts of the Nether. Lastly, we downloaded a 256k² area of the End at the same
  time. This final project took 109 days to complete, finishing in April 2026.

# Where's the Torrent?
Providing a Torrent for this amount of data is not easy whatsoever. We are currently working on creating a Torrent that
includes all data, but this may take a few weeks. We ask you to be a little patient with downloading this for yourself,
especially since the majority of people don't even have this amount of storage available. Renders at high resolution and
spreadsheets exported from the datamining will release separately prior to the Torrent, shortly after this post.

In the meantime, you can join the 2b2t.place Discord (https://discord.2b2t.place), which is our extension project
dedicated to archiving as much of 2b2t as possible before it turns into a boring, censored SMP, or if it shuts down.
We will also release the Torrent in our Discord server, so stay tuned. I will also edit this post to include the Torrent
once it's public.

We have now released over 8 GB of exported spreadsheets, timelapses and map renders 
[here](https://buzzheavier.com/uo3zhos4o21u). 

We also offer free services such as the 2b2t Wayback Machine (Server IP: `wayback.2b2t.place`) and a
[Map Website Viewer](https://2b2t.place) (https://2b2t.place). You can use these services right now to view the data for
yourself, while we are getting the Torrent ready. Both of these services are in a public beta, so please report any 
issues you may find, along with any suggestions you have, in our Discord server. Older snapshots are still in the 
process of being imported into the Wayback Machine server, but should be available relatively soon.

Many more open-source tools are coming to the public very soon, including PlaceProxy, the world download server, 
the zvcr file format, and much, much more. You can check out our GitHub at https://github.com/2b2tplace.

You can support the project by beta testing, helping the moderation team, providing data, making cool software, or 
simply being part of the community. More large-scale world downloads are yet to come, and they will be posted in our 
Discord server. Datamining also isn't ever complete, and we are open to your ideas to search the data for even more
interesting things.

You can also support the 2b2t.place project by donating via our Patreon at https://patreon.com/2b2tplace.
Your donation helps the 2b2t.place project keep up with ongoing server costs, enabling us to provide large-scale data
archival to the public. You may choose any of our Tiers, but you will receive the same benefits regardless of your
donation amount.

# Why is the Torrent taking so long ("a few weeks")?
During the project I have made terrible decisions with some of the backend software, which we now have to deal with as inevitable technical debt.
Due to this, there is an ongoing effort to reimport all of the missing tile entities so they actually appear in the ingame wayback server, but such that they are also reflected in the region files themselves. This will take approximately 4-5 more days to complete.

In the meantime, there is an additional effort to upgrade the entire 2024 512k² to the latest Minecraft version (1.20.4 -> 1.21.4), fixing the exact same issues with tile entities, and then importing the entire 2024 world download into the main archive, as a separate snapshot in time. This may also take a few extra days.

There is a lot of behind the scenes work going on, and we ask you to remain patient while we resolve these issues.

The final Torrent will likely be released as a Squashfs container, including the 2026 1m² Overworld, 2024 512k² Overworld, 2026 256k² End, and 2025 100k² Nether, as organized zvcr files in a single archive.

# Why is the software release taking so long?
A huge chunk of the software does not support tile entities yet. This includes the region file merging, exporting, importing and other miscellaneous code that would be necessary for a usable archive. I've been working on this project in parallel with studying for exams at university, which further delays the efforts to get this out quick.

Nonetheless, most of the software is feature-complete, and adding tile entity support should be doable relatively quickly, once I get a short rest from studying. This software will likely be released to the public around the same time as the Torrent.

Please be patient.

### Is this a repost of that 200k² that came out like a day ago?
This is a separate project with separate goals, that coincidentally happened to release around the same time. I want to
sincerely apologize to CrisisSheep and pawstar for the incredibly unfortunate timing. Their 200k² world download is a
big accomplishment and shouldn't be ignored, even if ours is much larger. You can check out their world download and 
Torrent in [their Reddit Post](https://reddit.com/r/2b2t_Uncensored/comments/1tefffd) and download it with the
[Torrent link](https://github.com/pawbase2b2t/2b2t.org-200k-Spawn-Download-2026/raw/refs/heads/main/2b2t%20200k%C2%B2%20Spawn%20Download%20-%202026.torrent)

# Credits
First and foremost I want to thank Fuch, for funding most of the operation through his hard work and dedication. 
Spending this much money on block game archival is just absolutely insane and none of this would've ever happened
without his help. So much was spent on priority queue purchases alone, but also server rental costs, adding up to over
$3000. Beyond funding, our combined autism has been a great motivating factor to finish this project in particular, out
of all the other ideas we had in mind and never got around to.

Secondly, I want to thank Steve3 and mahan for their huge help providing a separate BMProxy instance just for us
throughout all the world downloads we have done over the years. A big thanks goes to mahan in particular, for helping me
extensively stress test our private software (world download server, proxy, autopilot, zvcr file format), and having to
port my (honestly very horrible) autopilot code from the prototype Meteor addon to BMProxy. Along with this, he provided
a lot of great ideas that were implemented into the 2b2t.place software. Working with mahan has been the most enjoyable
experience from all my previous development teamwork ever, and without his and Steve's help, this project would have
taken at least another additional year to complete.

A huge thank you to SalC1 for making the YouTube video surrounding this world download project and spending countless
hours revising the script, editing, and going back and forth with us to make the video as high quality and perfect as
possible. This was despite him being originally done with 2b2t altogether, due to the censorship done by the server
owner(s) and of course due to Microslop. But given that he has a huge interest in archiving internet history, he was
still willing to make a video about our project, and I am very, very grateful for that. You can see he poured his heart
and soul into the video.

I want to thank all members of the Enclave that helped with the initial 512k² project in 2024. Many members contributed
their alternate Minecraft accounts for use in the project, adding up to 28 accounts in total. Thanks to Fuch, Cody4687
and expunged, a large portion of the priority queue costs during that project was also funded ($600+). I want to
especially thank catgirlmatty for being extremely supportive of this project and creating several videos about it. I 
want to thank her also for inviting me to the Enclave (given our shared interest in world downloading 2b2t, even if with
entirely different motives), and introducing me to Steve3, mahan, expunged, candyking24, Cody4687, WhiteAtlas, and 
Highatwork. The entire "Dofnear Exploit 2" larp was the funniest shit I've ever been a part of (although it may have 
slightly deceived the community... I guess this giant wall of text clears things up a little bit). Operation Fact Check
(OFC) as an organized project fueling Dofnear larp was extremely fun as well, and you can thank expunged and catgirlmatty
for the success of it; both of whom led the operation, with expunged managing most of the spreadsheet work and sending 
batches of coordinates to fact checkers. An astounding 2100+ locations were manually checked in-game by all contributors,
giving a final yield of over 600 dubs of stolen items, which is simply absurd.

Lastly, a huge thank you to [AustinGraphics](https://austin.is-a-good.dev/), for creating the frontend for the 
https://2b2t.place website. Thanks to his dedication to this project, we can host the full map of this project for 
everyone to see. I have never personally done any frontend development on my own, and I could have never made a website
as cool as this.

**Additional thanks and shoutouts to the following people, that also helped in one way or another:**
- antonymph, for providing accounts during the 2024 512k², fact checking many locations during OFC, being supportive all 
  throughout and correcting me on some wrong info that I gave to SalC1
- EastAlpha and Philipp, and the other members of the Devs, for coordinating with us on properly timing the releases of 
  the world download, and the their group logo project, also making the final render of the map way more interesting
- candyking24 and Russianxd, for helping check and filter many locations from the 1m², providing many interesting ideas 
  for the datamining process, and being supportive in general throughout the project. Additional thanks to candyking24
  for having a bot automatically log into 2b2t at Nether spawn every hour throughout January 2026 to add an insane 
  amount of snapshots to our Wayback Machine service. You can check this for yourself by joining `wayback.2b2t.place`,
  use `/tp 0 0 nether` and try out the Flashback feature using `/fb`.
- galicaea and candyking24 for their incredible singing used in the Enclave's Dofnear YouTube video
- H202 for staying supportive and not leaking the project, even after leaving the group, and for originally bringing up
  the funny idea to rename some of the used accounts after criminals named John.

**Thank you to the OFC fact checkers that contributed to the 600+ dubs of stolen items:**
mikuexpo, antonymph, galicaea, catgirlmatty, ilovelucki, Zandax, uh_sid, candyking24, browngirl, expunged, HighAtWork, 
KayQuack, WhiteAtlas and mahan.

### My role in the Project
It doesn't feel right to credit myself, but in case you're curious, I wrote the code for:
- the custom file format used to store the downloads (zvcr),
- PlaceProxy and the PlaceTools mod, which will soon allow anyone to contribute to our public archive,
- the 2b2t Wayback Machine, powered by PlaceViewer and zvcr, letting you flashback in time on the 2b2t map,
- the elytra autopilot(s) (an older version using the Boost elytra flight exploit, a newer version using Pitch40),
- the datamining program, to find all sorts of interesting things,
- core utilities to do operations with zvcr and mca region files (merge, render, upgrade, export, import, ...).

No AI/LLM's were used in the making of this project. Or writing this giant wall of text, if it gave you that impression.

## A Final Note
Although I probably spent the most time working on the code for this project, everyone involved deserves recognition,
because every contribution helped make this possible. I spent the better part of 1.5 years developing most the code used
for the world download, and this has been extremely exhausting. It would not have been possible to achieve all of this
if it wasn't for everyone mentioned above. I hope the community can make great use of the data provided by us, whether
to make the 2b2t experience more enjoyable, or to have a backup plan to give the server into the hands of the community,
just in case the 2b2t server owner(s) decide to make changes no one likes. It'll be interesting to see what the players
can come up with.
